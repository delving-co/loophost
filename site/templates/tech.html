<dt>How is it different?</dt> 
<dd>Supports unix domain sockets AND network ports. This makes it CRAZY FAST (about 3 times faster for the average web app)</dd>
<dd>No config files. Literally EVERYTHING is configured from within the web admin, and it reloads in real time.</dd>
<dd>Real-world certificates. No "snake-oil", no "self-signed", no "add to your trust store".</dd>
<dt>How is it the same?</dt>
<dd>Open Source. Everything we trust in the modern web stack is open source, and loophost is no exception.</dd>
<dd>Language-agnostic. While loophost is built to be super easy for Python developers to install, 
you can use it to develop in any language and framework</dd>

<dt>WHAT ABOUT...</dt>
<dd>Websockets? Yep.</dd>
<dd>Running in debug mode? Absolutely. Breakpoints work just as you would expect.</dd>
<dd>How many apps can I have running? We have no idea, let's find out together.</dd>
<dd>Sharing this with my team or using it for mobile dev? <a href="/upgrade.html">Time to upgrade.</a></br>
