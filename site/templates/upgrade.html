<dt>MOBILE DEV</dt> 

<dd>Building mobile apps means sharing your APIs from your laptop, to your Android, your iPhone, 
and the rest of your team. Once you've upgraded, you can simply flip the "sharing" toggle on
for any local app, and we'll TUNNEL traffic from the public internet to your local machine.</dd>

<dt>SECURE SHARING (COMING SOON!):</dt> 
<dd>Not ready to share with EVERYONE in the world? Enable "secured" sharing,
and you can issue individual certificates to each of your collaborators. (No password required).
No cert? No peeking.</dd>
